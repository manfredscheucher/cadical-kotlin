# cadical-kotlin

A [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) port of the
**CaDiCaL** SAT solver (Armin Biere and contributors). Plain Kotlin, no FFI and no native library, so it
runs on any Kotlin target (JVM, Android, native, browser).

The CaDiCaL search core (CDCL only, not the inprocessing machinery). `double` activities and EMAs are computed in the same order as the C.

It implements the `SatSolver` interface from
[ksat-common](https://github.com/manfredscheucher/ksat-common), which is pulled in as a
git submodule (mounted at `common/`). Package namespace is `org.bytefred.ksat`.

## Byte-for-byte port

This is a line-by-line port of the original C/C++ solver, checked to behave identically to
it (same decisions, propagations and conflicts, not just the final SAT/UNSAT answer). This
repo is just the solver source, usable on its own; the verification harness, benchmarks,
`Ksat` facade and docs live in the main project:
**[sat-solvers-kotlin](https://github.com/manfredscheucher/sat-solvers-kotlin)**.

## Build

Requires a JDK and the Gradle wrapper in this repo. `ksat-common` is a git submodule
mounted at `common/`, so clone recursively (a plain `git clone` leaves it empty and the
build fails with `No matching variant of project :ksat-common`):

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/manfredscheucher/cadical-kotlin.git
cd cadical-kotlin
```

Already cloned without `--recursive`? Pull the submodule in:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then build:

```bash
./gradlew compileKotlinJvm   # or build for all targets
```
