# cadical-kotlin

A [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) port of the
**CaDiCaL** SAT solver (Armin Biere and contributors). Plain Kotlin, no FFI and no native library, so it
runs on any Kotlin target (JVM, Android, native, browser).

All of CaDiCaL 2.1.3: the CDCL search, every inprocessing technique, the incremental and
IPASIR-UP API, model reconstruction and the proof tracers/checkers. The upstream `Solver` API
is a 1:1 translation in package `org.bytefred.ksat.cadical.full`; the class
`org.bytefred.ksat.cadical.CaDiCaL` puts the ksat-common `SatSolver` interfaces on top of it.

It implements the `SatSolver` interface from
[ksat-common](https://github.com/manfredscheucher/ksat-common), which is pulled in as a
git submodule (mounted at `common/`). Package namespace is `org.bytefred.ksat`.

## Byte-for-byte port

This is a line-by-line port of the original C/C++ solver, checked to behave identically to
it (same decisions, propagations and conflicts, not just the final SAT/UNSAT answer). This
repo is just the solver source, usable on its own. The `Ksat` facade over all four solvers is
in the main repo **[ksat](https://github.com/manfredscheucher/ksat)**;
the verification harness, benchmarks and the multiplatform demo are in its optional
**[ksat-extra](https://github.com/manfredscheucher/ksat-extra)** submodule.

## Build

Requires a JDK and the Gradle wrapper in this repo. `ksat-common` is a git submodule
mounted at `common/`, so clone recursively (a plain `git clone` leaves it empty and the
build fails with `No matching variant of project :ksat-common`):

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/manfredscheucher/cadical-kotlin.git
cd cadical-kotlin
```

Already cloned without `--recursive`? Pull the submodule in:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then build:

```bash
./gradlew compileKotlinJvm   # or build for all targets
```
